# Pedant

Pedant is a minimal math DSL. It's originally designed for use in cost
effectiveness analysis. However, it can be used for any important
calculations.

The goal of pedant is to make sure that it's difficult or impossible to
make math and stats errors, and also allow for the full enumeration of the
assumptions used for a calculation. Currently, its only feature is
dimensional analysis, but I'm planning to add stats and constraints on
stats in the future.

It might be better to think of pedant as a replacement for excel rather
than a programming language.

## Quick Start
To get started, we recommend visiting our [Installation Guide](installation.md). Then looking through some [examples](https://github.com/Hazelfire/pedant/tree/main/examples). Pedant should be pretty easy to get a hang of for the basics.
